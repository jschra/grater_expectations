# Grater Expectations

![grater_expectations](./docs/images/grater_expectations_background.png)

Welcome to Grater Expectations! In this repository, you will find code, notebooks and configurations that help you implement data testing using [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/). In doing so, a subset of logic was taken from Great Expectations - or *grated* - and implemented in Python to get you up, running and testing your data fast and as such, Grater Expectations was born!

In this project a combination of Python, Docker, Terraform and Azure or AWS services are used to enable you to quickly bootstrap a new project for testing your data. 


For more information on how to get started, please refer to the README file specific for the cloud provider you intend to use:

- [Azure](./README_AZURE.md)
-[AWS](./README_AWS.md)
