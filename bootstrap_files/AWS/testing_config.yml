# This is the configuration file that can be used to bootstrap files for your Grater
# Expectations project.

# For the overall project, there are global configurations which contain:
# - provider: the cloud provider for which the config was initialized. Set to AWS
# - account_id: the account_id of the AWS account to be used
# - region: the region used on AWS to deploy resources

# Make sure to set these to the AWS account you intend to use

# For each project, the following parameters can be found:
# - store_bucket: the S3 bucket that can be used to store Great Expectations outputs
# - store_bucket_prefix: the prefix (or 'folder') in which the GE outputs should be stored.
#   Defaults to root of the S3 bucket.
# - site_bucket: the S3 bucket that can be used for rendering Data Docs (static GE website)
# - site_bucket_prefix: the prefix (or 'folder') in which the files for the site should be stored.
#   Defaults to root of the S3 bucket.
# - site_name: the name that should be given to the rendered website
# - docker_image_name: the name that will be used for the docker image and ECR repository
#   to store the image on AWS
# - expectations_suite_name: the name for the expectation suite you will generate (
#   an expectations suite is GE yargon for a bundle of expectations you will use to validate
#   a dataset)
# - checkpoint_name: name for the checkpoint that will be used to validate your dataset
#   at runtime. Checkpoints are used to bundle expectation suites with data to
#   validate at runtime
# - run_name_template: the template to be used to tag validation runs with. If given
#   date string formats, these will be rendered at runtime using the date at runtime
# - data_bucket: the S3 bucket in which the data resides
# - prefix_data: prefix to data that can be used to load (example) dataset(s) to generate
#   expectations and run validations

# NOTE: for names of S3 buckets, only use hyphens ('-') and make sure they are globally unique
