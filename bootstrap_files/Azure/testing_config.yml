# This is the configuration file that can be used to bootstrap files for your Grater
# Expectations project for Azure.

# For the overall project, there are global configurations which contain:
# - provider: the cloud provider for which the config was initialized. Set to Azure
# - region: the region used on Azure to deploy resources

# For each project, the following parameters can be found:
# - resource_group_name: Name of the resource group to use for your project
# - storage_account: Name of the storage account wherein containers will be deployed for
#   storing data (can only be lowercase letters and numbers)
# - function_name: Name used for the testing Azure function to deploy (also used for name of app service)
# - container_registry_name: Name of the Azure Container Registry that will be provisioned
#   to push Docker image of Azure function towards
# - docker_image_name: the name that will be used for the docker image

# - site_name: the name that should be given to the rendered website
# - expectations_suite_name: the name for the expectation suite you will generate (
#   an expectations suite is GE yargon for a bundle of expectations you will use to validate
#   a dataset)
# - checkpoint_name: name for the checkpoint that will be used to validate your dataset
#   at runtime. Checkpoints are used to bundle expectation suites with data to
#   validate at runtime
# - run_name_template: the template to be used to tag validation runs with. If given
#   date string formats, these will be rendered at runtime using the date at runtime

# - data_container_name: The name of the container in which the data resides

# NOTE: for storage account names, only use lowercase letters and numbers and ensure their names are globally unique
